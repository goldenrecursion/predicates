## Example of Proper Usage
* '[The White House](https://golden.com/wiki/The_White_House-5KBY5)' → 'Full Address' → '1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW' should be accepted. This is a precise address with little ambiguity.

## Example of Improper Usage
* '[Painted Ladies](https://golden.com/wiki/Painted_ladies-NMJP9B)' → 'Full Address' → 'The neighborhood in San Francisco with painted houses on a hill' should be rejected. Even if there is only one area that fits this description (the address of the Painted Ladies section of San Francisco), this is not a precise and direct address for the entity.
