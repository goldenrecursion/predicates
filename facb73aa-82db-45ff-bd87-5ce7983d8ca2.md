## Example of Proper Usage
* '[Golden](https://golden.com/wiki/Golden-5R)' → 'Crunchbase URL' → 'https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/golden-2cb6' is correct, as this Crunchbase profile is a direct representation of Golden.

## Example of Improper Usage
* '[Apple](https://golden.com/wiki/Apple_(company)-5NB)' → 'Crunchbase URL' → 'https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/apple-pay' is incorrect, as this Crunchbase profile is for a subsidiary group of Apple (Apple Pay) and not the Crunchbase profile associated with Apple itself.
