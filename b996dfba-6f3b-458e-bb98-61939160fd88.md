## Example of Proper Usage
* [Ginkgo Bioworks](https://golden.com/wiki/Ginkgo_Bioworks-GE8DBAJ)' → 'Wikidata ID' → '[Q29026065](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29026065) is correct, as the wikidata page that this ID corresponds with https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q29026065 is the same Ginkgo Bioworks entity as the subject of the triple.

* [13 Club](https://dapp.golden.xyz/entity/0a797c2c-5c13-40c9-9fa5-1fd3b67dbc7f)' → 'Wikidata ID' → '[Q21208371](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21208371) is correct, as the Wikidata page that this ID corresponds with is the same entity as the subject of the triple. Note that a Wikidata ID with "No label defined" may be included here as long as the data on the corresponding Wikidata page confirms that it is the same entity. In this example, there is no English-language label, but an Italian-language label exists along with a corresponding Italian-language Wikipedia page for the entity and other data that confirms that this Wikidata ID is correct. 


## Example of Improper Usage
* '[Artificial Intelligence](https://golden.com/wiki/Artificial_intelligence-JNZDPNG)' → 'Wikidata ID' → '[Q4801030](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4801030)' is incorrect, as the wikidata page that this ID corresponds with https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4801030 is a journal about artificial intelligence and does not represent the topic ‘Artificial Intelligence’ like the Golden page does.
