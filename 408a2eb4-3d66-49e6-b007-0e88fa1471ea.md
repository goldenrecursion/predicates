## Example of Proper Usage
* '[Eric Balkanski](https://golden.com/wiki/Eric_Balkanski-394V48V)' → 'Doctoral Thesis Title' → 'The Adaptive Complexity of Submodular Optimization' is correct, citation: https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/42029793.

## Example of Improper Usage
* '[Eric Balkanski](https://golden.com/wiki/Eric_Balkanski-394V48V)' → 'Doctoral Thesis Title' → 'The Adaptive Complexity of Maximizing a Submodular Function' is incorrect, as it is the title of a related paper published prior to the dissertation, not the title of the thesis that was successfully defended.
