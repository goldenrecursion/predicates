## Example of Proper Usage
* '[Mark Zuckerberg](https://golden.com/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg-AZ9)' → 'Date of Birth' → '1984-05-14', citation: https://www.facebook.com/zuck/about_contact_and_basic_info 1. This citation points to an official page for Mark Zuckerberg (as further evidenced by Facebook's 'blue check' on the profile) that states Mark Zuckerberg's birthday.

## Example of Improper Usage
* '[Apple](https://golden.com/wiki/Apple_(company)-5NB)' → 'Date of Birth' → '1976-04-01' is incorrect, as an entity with 'is a' → 'company' cannot have a date of birth.
