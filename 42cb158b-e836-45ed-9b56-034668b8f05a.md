## Example of Proper Usage
*  '[Tim Cook](https://golden.com/wiki/Tim_Cook-N9YN83)' → 'Website URL' → 'www.apple.com/leadership/tim-cook/' is correct, as this is an official website directly associated with Tim Cook. There is further evidence this is the primary website associated with Tim Cook by the lack of other official domains directly associated with Tim Cook.

## Example of Improper Usage
* '[Tim Cook](https://golden.com/wiki/Tim_Cook-N9YN83)' → 'Website URL' → 'Apple.com' is incorrect, as while Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple and thus connected to the brand behind the URL, 'Apple.com' is not a website directly associated with Tim Cook (but rather is one directly associated with [Apple](https://golden.com/wiki/Apple_(company)-5NB)).
