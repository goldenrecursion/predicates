## Example of Proper Usage:
* '[US Patent D0974555 Endoscope operating unit](https://golden.com/wiki/US_Patent_D0974555_Endoscope_operating_unit-P48V3Y5/)' → 'Patent Number' → 'D0974555' is correct. Note that the Patent Number may be labeled as "Patent No." and is almost always in the top right corner of the first page of the patent document. The Patent Number should be listed without the preceding "US" and without the commas that often appear in the patent document.
