## Example of Improper Usage
* '[Richard Feynman](https://golden.com/wiki/Richard_Feynman-JN6VE)' → 'Doctoral Thesis URL' → 'https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/5852##t=aboutBook' is incorrect, as this URL points to an overview of Richard Feynman's Doctoral Thesis URL, but does not provide the original text of his doctoral thesis or an option to download the original text.
