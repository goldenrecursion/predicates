## Example of Proper Usage:
* '[React](https://golden.com/wiki/React-DYD3ZA)' -> 'Source Code URL' -> 'https://github.com/facebook/react' is correct, as this is the primary and official Source Code URL for React (the version history and number of watchers/forks/stars are useful proxies to help confirm this).
* '[Solidity](https://golden.com/wiki/Solidity-DWBADB)' -> 'Source Code URL' -> 'https://github.com/ethereum/solidity' is correct, as this is the primary and official Source Code URL for React (the version history and number of watchers/forks/stars are useful proxies to help confirm this).

## Example of Improper Usage:
* '[React](https://golden.com/wiki/React-DYD3ZA)' -> 'Source Code URL' -> 'https://github.com/facebook' is incorrect, as while https://github.com/facebook has a repository containing React's primary and official source code, https://github.com/facebook is not itself a direct link to React's source code.
* '[React](https://golden.com/wiki/React-DYD3ZA)' -> 'Source Code URL' -> 'https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker' is incorrect, as 'https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker' is a package built for React applications, but not the primary and official React Source Code URL.
* '[Solidity](https://golden.com/wiki/Solidity-DWBADB)' -> 'Source Code URL' -> 'https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog' is incorrect, as while this Source Code URL is officially associated with Solidity as its blog, it is not the primary Source Code URL.
