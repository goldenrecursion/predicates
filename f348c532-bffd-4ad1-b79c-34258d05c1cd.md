# Description
URL of an organization's, product's, or cryptocurrency’s official community forum. Unofficial community forum's (such as those that the organization, product, or cryptocurrency has never officially affiliated themselves with) should not be used.

# Example of Proper Usage
* '[Ethereum](https://golden.com/wiki/Ethereum-W4Z)' -> 'Community Forum URl' -> 'https://ethereum-magicians.org/' is correct, as this is one primary and official community forum URL for Ethereum, as referenced by Ethereum's official list of online communities https://ethereum.org/en/community/online/.

# Example of Improper Usage
* '[Ethereum](https://golden.com/wiki/Ethereum-W4Z)' -> 'Community Forum URl' -> 'https://www.reddit.com/r/EthereumCommunity/' is incorrect, as while this seems to be a significant community supporting Ethereum, it has no official affiliation with Ethereum per the Ethereum foundation's list of affiliated communities https://ethereum.org/en/community/online/
