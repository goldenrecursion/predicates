# Golden Protocol Predicate Definitions
The contents in this repo populate many of the fields found in predicate definition pages on [dapp.golden.xyz](https://dapp.golden.xyz/). Each .md file in this repo corresponds to one predicate's definition page, i.e. [12acb8fe-0573-4ca8-8cc1-180cc6ba3486.md](./12acb8fe-0573-4ca8-8cc1-180cc6ba3486.md) corresponds to the predicate definition page shown [here](https://dapp.golden.xyz/predicate/12acb8fe-0573-4ca8-8cc1-180cc6ba3486)

A brief overview: predicates are used in triples - the building blocks of facts that link entities together forming a graph. The Golden protocol supports a rich schema with a growing number of predicates and qualifiers. Anyone can propose changes by opening a PR in this repo, but conversations and voting on which changes to merge will primarily take place on our [Discourse Forum](https://forum.golden.xyz/).
