## Example of Proper Usage:
* '[Twitter Series C round, February 12, 2009](https://golden.com/wiki/Twitter_Series_C_round%2C_February_12%2C_2009-W4ZZ55K)' → 'Date Announced' → 'February 13, 2009' is correct, citation: https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2009/opportunity-knocks.html.

## Example of Improper Usage:
* '[Twitter Series C round, February 12, 2009](https://golden.com/wiki/Twitter_Series_C_round%2C_February_12%2C_2009-W4ZZ55K)' → 'Date Announced' → 'February 12, 2009' is incorrect because this was the date the round closed, rather than the date it was announced. Often a funding round will be announced after the actual date the round has closed. Citation: https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/a/2009/opportunity-knocks.html.
