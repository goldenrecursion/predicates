# Example of Proper Usage
* [Facebook](https://golden.com/wiki/Facebook_(platform)-3R5)' -> 'Google Play store URL' -> 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana&gl=US is correct, as this is the primary and official Google Play Store URL for the Facebook product as evidenced by it being listed in the official Meta (parent organization of Facebook) developer account [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Meta+Platforms,+Inc.&gl=US)

# Example of Improper Usage
* '[Snapchat](https://golden.com/wiki/Instagram-GP4KKM)' -> 'Google Play Store URL' -> 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ignates.findfriends' is incorrect, as this URL does not point to an app directly owned by and associated with Snapchat but rather to an app simply using Snapchat data. It is also not officially operated by Snap Inc per Snap Inc's [developer profile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Snap+Inc)
