## Example of Proper Usage:
* '[Facebook](https://golden.com/wiki/Facebook_(platform)-3R5)' -> 'Instagram URL' -> 'https://www.instagram.com/facebook/' is correct, as this is the primary and official Instagram URL for Facebook. The blue check mark seen [here](https://jmp.sh/ypvtVEg+/Screen+Shot+2022-07-26+at+3.30.21+PM.png) on the profile helps confirm this.

## Example of Improper Usage:
*  '[Jeff Bezos](https://golden.com/wiki/Jeff_Bezos-D63VY)' -> 'Instagram URL' -> 'https://www.instagram.com/jeffbezos.fan/' is incorrect, as this profile is not the primary and official Instagram profile associated with Jeff Bezos but rather a fan account with no evidence of an official affiliation.
